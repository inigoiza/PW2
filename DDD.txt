Design Detailed Document (DDD)
1. Description of the work
This project consists of the development of a personal website created as part of the Practical Work II for the subject Fundamentals of Computer Engineering.
The objective of the website is to present a structured overview of the project, demonstrate the use of HTML and CSS, and provide access to different sections related to the degree and the contents learned during the course.
The website has been developed using only standard web technologies:
- HTML for structure
- CSS for layout and styling
The project follows the required folder structure and includes multiple interconnected pages, a global stylesheet, image assets, and proper documentation.

2. Website structure
The website is composed of the following sections:
1. Home (index.html):
    Presents the purpose of the website and provides an overview of all available sections.
2. About:
    Contains personal information, skills, languages, images, and social media links represented by icons.
3. Degree:
    Shows an overview of the Computer Engineering degree, organized by academic year and subjects.
4. FCE:
    Dedicated page for Fundamentals of Computer Engineering, explaining its objectives and relevance within the degree.
5. Topic:
    A thematic page focused on a specific topic related to computer engineering, in this case cybersecurity basics.
6. Net:
    Includes links to classmates’s websites developed as part of the same subject.
7. Contact:
    A contact form implemented using HTML only, without data storage or scripting.

3. Development considerations
During the development of the project, the following considerations were applied:
A single external CSS file is used for all HTML pages. (I had to adjust a lot of things as i moved on)
All images are stored in a folder to mantain order i guess.
The project structure strictly follows the guidelines provided.
No JavaScript or external libraries were used, even though i was tempted to use JS or Bootstrap.

4. Problems during the development
Did not have many problems as i have already done this Practical Work once and i have passed my theoretical examns in web development

5. Conclusions
This project allowed the practical application of fundamental web development concepts using HTML and CSS.
It also reinforced the importance of project structure, version control, and documentation.
The final result is a functional and well organized website that meets all the requirements of the practical work and demonstrates the skills acquired during the course.
